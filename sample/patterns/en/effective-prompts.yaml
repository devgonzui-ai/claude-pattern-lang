# Effective Prompt Pattern Library
# Best practices for communicating with Claude Code

patterns:
  - id: en-prompt-001
    name: Context Providing Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When requesting new features or complex fixes
    solution: Include file paths and background information in instructions
    example_prompt: |
      Read src/auth/login.ts and src/auth/types.ts,
      then add remember-me functionality to the login function.
      Set token expiration to 30 days.
    tags: [prompt-engineering, context, clarity]
    notes: Explicit file paths help AI navigate directly

  - id: en-prompt-002
    name: Constraint Stating Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When requesting implementation with specific constraints
    solution: Clearly communicate implementation constraints
    example_prompt: |
      Performance is critical, implement with O(n) complexity.
      Don't add external libraries, use only standard library.
    tags: [prompt-engineering, constraints, requirements]

  - id: en-prompt-003
    name: Example Giving Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When showing expected output format or behavior
    solution: Provide input/output examples
    example_prompt: |
      Create a function to format dates as "January 29, 2024".
      Example: new Date('2024-01-29') -> 'January 29, 2024'

  - id: en-prompt-004
    name: Iterative Refinement Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When improving upon existing implementation
    solution: Point to current code and specify improvements
    example_prompt: |
      The function in src/utils/formatter.ts seems slow.
      Improve performance by caching the regex patterns.

  - id: en-prompt-005
    name: Step By Step Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When requesting multi-step work
    solution: Number the steps for clear instruction
    example_prompt: |
      Implement in these steps:
      1. Create type definitions in src/types/user.ts
      2. Implement in src/services/user.ts
      3. Add tests in tests/user.test.ts
    tags: [prompt-engineering, workflow, multi-step]

  - id: en-prompt-006
    name: Comparison Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When evaluating multiple approaches
    solution: Ask for comparison with reasoning
    example_prompt: |
      I need authentication functionality.
      Consider both JWT and session-based approaches,
      then implement the one that fits this project.
      Explain why you chose it.
    tags: [prompt-engineering, architecture, decision-making]

  - id: en-prompt-007
    name: Clarification Requesting Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When requirements are unclear
    solution: Ask AI to gather requirements by asking questions
    example_prompt: |
      I want to define the feature specifications.
      Organize the considerations and ask me questions.
    tags: [prompt-engineering, requirements, clarification]

  - id: en-prompt-008
    name: Test First Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When requesting testable implementation
    solution: Ask for tests first or test + implementation together
    example_prompt: |
      Implement in a testable way.
      Write test code first, then implement so tests pass.
    tags: [prompt-engineering, tdd, testing]

  - id: en-prompt-009
    name: Explain Then Implement Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When wanting to understand approach before implementation
    solution: Ask for explanation first, then implementation
    example_prompt: |
      First explain how you would implement this feature,
      including file structure and dependencies.
      After I approve, implement it.
    tags: [prompt-engineering, planning, explanation]

  - id: en-prompt-010
    name: Style Consistency Prompt
    type: prompt
    context: When requesting code that matches existing style
    solution: Reference existing code as style guide
    example_prompt: |
      Follow the same coding style as src/components/Header.tsx.
      Use the same naming conventions and structure.
